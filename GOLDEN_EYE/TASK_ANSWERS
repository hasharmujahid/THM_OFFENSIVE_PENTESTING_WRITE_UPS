Boris, I can break your codes!

Boris,

Your cooperation with our syndicate will pay off big. Attached are the final access codes for GoldenEye. 
Place them in a hidden file within the root directory of this server then remove from this email. 
There can only be one set of these acces codes, and we need to secure them for the final execution. 
If they are retrieved and captured our plan will crash and burn!

Once Xenia gets access to the training site and becomes familiar with the 
GoldenEye Terminal codes we will push to our final stages....

Natalya, please you need to stop breaking boris' codes. Also, you are GNO supervisor for training. I will email you once a student is designated to you.

Also, be cautious of possible network breaches. We have intel that GoldenEye is being sought after by a crime syndicate named Janus.

Ok Natalyn I have a new student for you. As this is a new system please let me or boris know if you see any config issues, especially is it's related to security...even if it's not, just enter it in under the guise of "security"...it'll get the change order escalated without much hassle :)

Ok, user creds are:

Boris verified her as a valid contractor so just create the account ok?

And if you didn't have the URL on outr internal Domain: severnaya-station.com/gnocertdir
**Make sure to edit your host file since you usually work remote off-network....

Since you're a Linux user just point this servers IP to severnaya-station.com in /etc/hosts.
